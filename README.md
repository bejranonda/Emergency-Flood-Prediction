**Bangkok Flood Prediction 2011** is an emergency response system that provided real-time flood forecasts when official models failed during Thailand's worst natural disaster. Using ARIMA time series models and spatial interpolation, it predicted water levels 5 days in advance across Bangkok's neighborhoods—empowering 13 million residents to protect their homes when government forecasts were unavailable.
 
All predictions were shared freely via WooWooWuu.de, filling a critical information void during Thailand's $45B flood crisis.

## Project Overview

This project was developed in October-November 2011 during the **great Thailand floods** to provide real-time flood predictions for residents and authorities in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA). The predictions helped individuals and communities assess flood risk, determine whether flood protection barriers would be sufficient, and make critical decisions about protecting their homes and evacuating.

### The Problem

During the 2011 floods, the Bangkok area faced a critical information gap:

- **Insufficient monitoring infrastructure**: Lack of monitoring stations and water level measurement points across the metropolitan area
- **No suitable models**: After the flood inundated greater Bangkok, existing hydrological models became ineffective for urban flood prediction
- **Limited situational awareness**: People in flood-affected areas could not determine if water levels were rising or falling
- **No advance forecasting**: The government could not forecast and announce the flood situation in advance due to the complexity of flood movement in urban areas

### The Solution

This project addressed these challenges through a **data-driven forecasting approach**:

- **Self-driving predictions**: Used existing water level data to forecast water levels 5 days ahead
- **Spatial interpolation**: Created flood maps showing water levels across individual neighborhoods
- **Actionable information**: Enabled residents to make informed decisions about barrier reinforcement or relocating valuables
- **Real-time dissemination**: All predictions were released publicly through **WooWooWuu.de** website and **WooWooWuu** Facebook page, created specifically for flood relief

### What People Needed to Know

Residents in flooded areas had simple but critical questions:
- Do I need to prepare more sandbag barriers?
- Should I relocate valuable items to higher floors?
- Will the water level rise or fall in the next few days?
- Will flood walls at 2.5m, 2.8m, or 3.0m MSL be sufficient for my area?

This project empowered individuals to **mitigate their own risk** with hyperlocal flood predictions.

## Historical Context

The 2011 Thailand floods were among the worst flooding disasters in the country's history:
- **Affected over 13 million people**
- **Caused estimated damages of $45.7 billion USD**
- **Lasted from July to December 2011**
- **Required large-scale evacuations and emergency responses**

This project represents a real-time scientific response to a major natural disaster, developed under emergency conditions to fill a critical information void.

## Methodology

### 1. Time Series Prediction (ARIMA/AR Models)

**Location:** `scripts/arima/`

The project uses **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** models to forecast water levels:

- **AR (AutoRegressive) Models**: Orders 1-2 tested for simple predictions
- **ARIMA Models**: Various parameter combinations (p,d,q) tested with stepwise and non-stepwise selection
- **ARIMAx (External Regressors)**: Used sea level and ocean climate indices as external predictors for improved accuracy

**Key Scripts:**
- `arimaBKK.R`: Initial prediction model using 25 days of water level data from September 2011
- `arimaBKK-2.R`: Updated model using 18 days of data for November predictions
- `testAR.R`: Comprehensive AR/ARIMA model testing with multiple GCM scenarios and ocean indices

**Data Sources:**
- **Water Level Observations**: Chao Phraya River at Royal Thai Navy Headquarters
- **Sea Level Data**: Tidal predictions and observations (24-hour cycles)
- **Ocean Indices**: ENSO, SST, and other climate indicators (1971-2009)
- **Climate Models**: ECHO-G GCM projections (A1B, A2, B1 scenarios) for robustness testing

**Model Performance:**
- **Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)**: Measures predictive power (-∞ to 1, where 1 = perfect)
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy in meters
- **Forecast Horizon**: 5 days ahead with confidence intervals
- **Validation**: 50% calibration, 50% verification split-sample approach

**Best Performing Model:**
```r
auto.arima(water_level, xreg=sea_level, d=1, stepwise=FALSE)
```
This ARIMAx model with sea level as external regressor provided the most accurate 5-day forecasts.

### 2. Spatial Interpolation

**Location:** `scripts/spatial/`

**Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** interpolation creates continuous flood risk maps from point observations:

- **Grid Resolution**: 1000m × 1000m
- **Extension**: 5000m buffer around observation points
- **Input**: Water level measurements from multiple stations across Bangkok
- **Output**: Raster surfaces showing predicted water levels across BMA
- **Method**: `gstat::krige()` function in R

**Key Scripts:**
- `interpolateV1.R`: Initial IDW implementation
- `interpolateV2.R`: Improved version with better grid generation (**recommended**)
- `readSHP.R`: Utilities for reading Bangkok administrative boundaries

**Process:**
1. Collect point measurements from distributed stations
2. Generate uniform grid across BMA
3. Apply IDW algorithm to interpolate between points
4. Overlay Bangkok district boundaries
5. Generate PDF maps showing flood levels by neighborhood

### 3. Flood Risk Assessment

**Critical Thresholds:**
- **2.5m MSL**: General flood protection wall height
- **2.8m MSL**: Top-up wall height
- **3.0m MSL**: Extra top-up wall height

The predictions compared forecasted water levels against these thresholds to assess flood risk for different districts, helping residents determine if their barriers would hold.

### 4. Visualization and Dissemination

**Location:** `output/maps/forecasting/`

Daily flood status maps were generated showing:
- Current water levels
- Predicted water levels (5-day forecast)
- Areas at risk of inundation
- Flow direction and magnitude
- Comparison against flood wall heights

**Map Versions:**
- **V2-V7**: Progressive improvements in accuracy and detail throughout October-November
- **Animations**: GIF files showing flood progression over time
- **Charts**: Time series plots with prediction intervals and confidence bounds

## Results and Impact

### Applications

The predictions enabled:
1. **Individual risk mitigation**: Residents could prepare barriers or evacuate based on 5-day forecasts
2. **Community planning**: Neighborhoods coordinated barrier construction and evacuation efforts
3. **Infrastructure protection**: Businesses and institutions protected assets based on predicted water levels
4. **Public awareness**: Daily maps showed which areas were at risk, reducing uncertainty

### Public Dissemination

- **Website**: WooWooWuu.de hosted all daily predictions and maps
- **Facebook**: WooWooWuu page provided updates and answered questions from affected residents
- **Free Access**: All information provided at no cost during the emergency

This grassroots approach filled the information gap when official forecasts were unavailable, empowering individuals to protect themselves and their communities.
